### Out with the Old
After nearly a decade of running **markepps.com** on [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) hosted on a [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) droplet, I've decided it's time for a change. 

### In with the New
So, what's changed? I've moved to something simpler. The new site is built with the open-source static site generator [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and hosted on [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/).
It's free, fast, simple and secure. 

### How It's Built
The entire site is managed through a Git repo - [markymarkepps/markepps-com](https://github.com/markymarkepps/markepps-com). I write a post locally, push the changes to GitHub, and Cloudflare Pages takes care of the rest.

### What's Next?
The goal is to use this new platform to learn more about git, homelab projects, and hopefully share a recap of this years trip through Europe.

Thanks!
